// ============================================================================
// PERSONAS — the research packages' own test cases, run against the real trees.
//
// Each wave package ships five personas per state: "(1) misdemeanor 2019, no
// probation issues → likely ALREADY auto-relieved — check-record path". Those
// are the acceptance criteria the research wrote, and until now nothing ran them.
//
// The fixture keeps TWO things apart on purpose:
//
//   `package`  — the persona text, VERBATIM from the wave package. This is the
//                spec. It is not paraphrased, because a paraphrase is where a
//                test quietly starts asserting what the code does instead of
//                what the research said.
//   `expect`   — MY reading of that text as a result key. This is the part a
//                reviewer referees. If a test fails, the first question is not
//                "is the tree wrong" but "is this mapping wrong".
//
// `expectIsApproximate` marks a mapping to the CLOSEST EXISTING key because the
// package describes an outcome the tree has no result for. A green check on one
// of those is a FINDING, NOT A PASS: it means the suite agrees with a tree that
// does not do what the research asked for. Grep for it.
//
//   grep -c "expectIsApproximate: true" src/data/personas.test.ts
//
// `now` is pinned. A persona like "eligible 2025" is a claim about a date, and
// a suite whose answers change with the calendar is a suite that rots.
//
// Gaps found here are INVENTORIED, not fixed. No branch gets added to a tree to
// make a persona go green.
